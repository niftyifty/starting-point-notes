The Magento Admin is protected by multiple layers of security measures to prevent
unauthorized access to your store, order, and customer data. The first time you sign in
to the Admin, you are required to enter your username and password and to set up twofactor authentication (2FA).
Depending on the configuration of your store, you might also be required to resolve a
CAPTCHA challenge such as entering a series of keyboard characters, solving a puzzle,
or clicking a series of images with a common theme. These tests are designed to
identify you has human, rather than an automated bot.
For additional security, you can determine which parts of the Admin each user has
permission to access, and also limit the number of login attempts. By default, after
six attempts the account is locked, and the user must wait a few minutes before trying
again. Locked accounts can also be reset from the Admin.
An Admin password must be seven or more characters long and include both letters and
numbers.
