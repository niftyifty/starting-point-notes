Absolutely! Here's an **ELI5-style explanation** of the **rest of the key Windows pentesting and cybersecurity terms** — grouped into themes for clarity:

---

## 🧠 Authentication & Credentials

### 🔐 NTLM

Imagine your friend says a secret code when entering your clubhouse. If someone hears it, they can **reuse that code** to get in — even if they’re not your friend. That’s **NTLM** — an old way of checking passwords that's easy to trick.

### 🪪 Kerberos

It’s like getting a **hall pass** from a trusted teacher (Ticket Granting Ticket). You show it to other teachers (services), and they let you in. It’s safer than just saying your name and hoping they believe you.

### 🧠 LSASS

This is the **brain vault** on your computer. It stores passwords and security info in memory. If a hacker can peek inside, they can see secret stuff.

### 🗃️ SAM

Think of SAM as a **little locked notebook** on your computer that stores all the usernames and password hints. If someone steals this book, they can try cracking those secrets.

---

## 🏢 Active Directory Concepts

### 🏛️ Domain Controller (DC)

This is the **principal’s office** of your network school. It decides who gets access, what they can do, and keeps everything organized.

### 🌲 Forest

A **forest** is like a **whole school district** — full of different schools (domains) that can work together or stay separate.

### 🧾 Group Policy Object (GPO)

Imagine the principal says: “All computers must have the same wallpaper and no YouTube.” That’s GPO — rules for all the computers.

---

## 🧪 Common Attacks

### 🧂 Pass-the-Hash (PtH)

If a password is like a secret cookie recipe, PtH is like **using a picture of the cookie** to pretend you have the recipe. It works even if you don’t know the real ingredients (password).

### 🎫 Pass-the-Ticket (PtT)

You steal someone’s **hall pass** and use it to get into places pretending you’re them.

### 🥩 Kerberoasting

You ask the lunch lady (server) for a sealed lunch bag (ticket), take it home, and **try to guess what’s inside** (crack the password).

### 🥓 AS-REP Roasting

This is like finding a **locker with no lock**, and trying to open it by just guessing the number — because the user didn’t set up extra protection.

### 🪙 Golden Ticket

You forge a **magic VIP badge** that works forever and gives you access to anything in the school (network).

### 🥈 Silver Ticket

Like a **movie ticket stub** that lets you sneak into one particular room (service), not the whole theater (domain).

### 🪜 Lateral Movement

You sneak from **one room to another**, using unlocked doors or borrowed keys (credentials), slowly working toward the principal’s office (admin access).

---

## 🧰 Tools (Think Hacker Gadgets)

### 🧙 Mimikatz

This is like a **magic wand** that can pull out passwords from memory, make fake tickets, and impersonate users.

### 🧠 BloodHound

It draws a **map of who can talk to who** and who can become a boss (admin). It helps hackers plan their way to the top.

### 🐍 Impacket

A hacker’s **toolbox** full of scripts for talking to Windows computers in sneaky ways.

### 🧨 Evil-WinRM

Like a **remote-controlled robot** that lets you control a computer with admin powers.

### 🛠️ PsExec

You press a button, and a remote computer runs whatever you told it to — like launching a program from far away.

### 🕵️ CrackMapExec

A **Swiss Army knife** for checking doors, spraying passwords, and seeing what you can break into.

---

## 🌐 Networking & Protocols

### 📂 SMB

It’s like the **hallway lockers** used to share books (files). Sometimes the locks are weak — hackers love that.

### 🧑‍💻 WinRM

It’s like **remote control for Windows** computers. If you get access, it’s like having a virtual keyboard and screen.

### 📡 WMI

Think of it like a **walkie-talkie** system for computers — you can ask questions or tell them to run things.

### 📞 RPC

This lets you call someone in another room and ask them to do something, like "print this file" — even if you're not near them.

---

## 🧾 Hashes & Tickets

### #️⃣ NTLM Hash

A scrambled version of your password. Like writing your password in a secret code.

### 🧓 LM Hash

An **ancient version** of the password code — like using pig Latin. Easy to break.

### 🎟️ TGT / TGS

* **TGT**: A magic token saying, “This kid is allowed in school.”
* **TGS**: A note saying, “This kid is allowed in the science lab.” (specific service)

### 🧙 KRBTGT

A special **secret master key** that signs all the TGTs. If a hacker steals this, they can make fake IDs that work anywhere.

---

## 🧑‍💼 Users / Admins

### 🆔 SID

It’s like your **student ID number**. Unique and used for tracking access.

### 🧮 RID

The **last part** of your SID. 500 = Principal (Administrator), 501 = Guest, etc.

### 👀 Admin Shares (`C$`, `ADMIN$`)

**Secret back doors** that only the janitors (admins) know about.

---

## 🔍 Recon / Enumeration

### 📖 LDAP

A **directory book** listing every user, room, and computer in the building.

### 💻 `net user`, `net group`, etc.

Think of these as **asking the front desk** for lists of people and rooms.

### 🧍 whoami

You’re checking your **student ID badge** to see who you are and what privileges you have.

---

## 🧬 Persistence / Backdoors

### 🧰 Service Creation

Like a hacker installing a **fake cleaning robot** that runs their code every time.

### 🧪 DLL Hijacking

Sneaking your own code into a **toolbox**, so when someone runs a normal program, **your code runs instead**.

### ⏰ Scheduled Task

You set a **reminder alarm** to do something bad every night — like turning off the cameras.
