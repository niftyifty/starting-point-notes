# MySQL 

* MySQL is a service used for connecting to SQL servers.
* A cheatsheet can be found [here.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-cheat-sheet/)

## Usage
* To connect to a server:
  * `mysql -h {target-ip} -u username`, where:
    * `-h` specifies the host
    * `-u` specifies the username you will use.
      * Note to use `root` as the username to try.

* Valuable commands:
  * `SHOW databases;` : Prints out the databases we can access.

  * `USE {database_name};` : Set to use the database named {database_name}.

  * `SHOW tables;` : Prints out the available tables inside the current database.

  * `SELECT * FROM {table_name};` : Prints out all the data from the table {table_name}.
