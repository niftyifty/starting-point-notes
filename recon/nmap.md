# NMap
Ô∑Ω 	
## Useful resources: 
* [Cheatsheet](https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet/)
* `man nmap`
## Notes
* TCP Protocol: 
  * Starts w/ a SYN(chronisation) packet
  * Next is a SYN-ACK packet
  * Finished with an ACK packet.
    * **This is a three-way handshake.**

## Commands
* The `-T{number}` adjusts speed of the nmap scan. **For instance**:
  * `-T1` is slow, but you are careful and quiet.
  * `-T5` is very fast, but you might make more noise and miss more things.
  * Only use `-T5` when you dc about detection and you are in a trusted network. **It will trip firewalls.**
* Enable verbose mode by using the `-v` flag. **Nmap tells you what's happening step-by-step**.
  * You can increase amount of verbosity by adding `v`'s, eg. `-vvv` is extremely verbose and tells us EVERYTHING
* `-oX network-map.xml` and saves into an XML file for us to get a graphical view of all data from the scan.
  * This can be turned into a nice HTML file by running `xsltproc ./network-map.xml -o ./network-map.html`.
* `-F` flag uses top 100 ports only.

* `nmap -sn {target-subnet}` checks if hosts are alive. It's a "no ports scan" that scans the IP but no ports and is fast.
* From there, you can select an IP and run a default scan against it.
* The `-sV` flag allows us to view the specific versions of these services active, so we know what exploits to use. As we're enumerating deeper, it takes longer.
* The `-sC` flag uses default scripts from the `nmap scripting engine` against the target for adv recon.
* [SYN Scan]: The flag `-sS` in `sudo nmap -sS {ip} -p 443,8080` will scan ports 443 and 8080 of the target IP stealthily [-sS] by only sending a SYN packet.
  * This avoids tripping firewalls
* On the other hand, the `-sT` switch [TCP Control Scan] does the entire 3-way handshake
  * Slower, easier to detect but *doesn't require permissions* and you can make sure you have full connections.
* `-sU` can be used for a UDP scan
* The `-O` flag detects OSes
* The `-A` (Aggressive mode) flag is a combination of a few switches. Very informative but takes _ages_.

#### Obfuscation and avoiding detection
* Obfuscation helps you remain undetected. For example, `sudo nmap -sS -D {decoy-ip} {target-ip}` will send packets from both your IP and the decoy to throw blueteam off your tracks :)
* `nmap --spoof-mac 00:11:22:33:44:55 192.168.1.10` will spoof the MAC Addr. given.


#### Scripting
* Scripts can be used against targets to find vulnerabilities. Automation >>
* Example: `sudo nmap --script vuln {target-ip}` will attack the target with all Scripts in the [vuln] category on nmap scripting website and find exploits :)
* Applied examples:
  * `sudo nmap -p 443,8080 --script vuln {target-ip}`
    * Runs an nmap scan on the target IP's ports 443 and 8080 (web server) with the
  * `nmap -p 139,445 --script smb-os-discovery,smb-enum-shares,smb-enum-users {target-ip}`
    * SMB enumeration

# üß† How to Use This with Ollama

If you want to use a local LLM like Ollama to **ask which command to use**, you can **pipe the cheatsheet into it** like this:

### Step 1: Save this cheatsheet to a file

```bash
nano nmap_cheatsheet.txt
```

(paste the above content)

### Step 2: Use a command like:

```bash
ollama run llama3 < nmap_cheatsheet.txt
```

Then ask:

> "Which command should I use to scan all ports and detect services on a host that might have ICMP blocked?"
