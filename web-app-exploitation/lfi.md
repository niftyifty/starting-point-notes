# LFI - Local File Inclusion
ï·½
* LFI, or Local File Inclusion is the process of including files that are already locally present on the server, through the exploitation of vulnerable inclusion procedures implemented in an application.
## how to detect it
* the `URL` for the web app, if susceptible to `LFI`, will change to something like `http://{website}/?file=home.php`.
* this is a common method for dynamically loading files.
* if not programmed correctly, it can be exploited.

### known:
* try to load a file that we know exists on the machine and is readable by ALL users. we will use `/etc/passwd`.
* for instance;
  * `curl 'http://{website}/?file=/etc/passwd'`
* note that in some cases, the file path is concatenated onto the existing one, so we need to manually `cd` to the root of the system:
  * `curl 'http://{website}/?file=../../../../../../etc/passwd'`
## usage of the exploit
